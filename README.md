# Drury Buildings #
*My ever first project in coding* is presenting a great place in Dublin City Centre where any person who interested in a tasty small bite or a large dish, a great drink or a high-standard cocktail is looking at the right website. 

The users can find a short description about the history of the place, menu, details regarding the scheduele, contact information and useful links for social media. 

## Features ##

* ### Navigation ### 

   * Starting with the header on the left corner is the name of the venue that links to the home page when clicked.
   * The Menu is on the right side next to the home page again just to be sure the users will find easy the access to the home page.
   * The short description under the header has a paragraph finishing with a link to Menu page when cliked. 
   * At the bottom of the home page in the contact details section, the reservation email when clicked sends the user straight to the email program.
   * The footer contains clickable icons linked to social media platforms.

* ### The Header ###
  * The clickable navigation pages in the header display a red bottom line when we hover the mouse over them. 
  * The header image is the front of the building and has an animation keyframe that brings the attention on the home page while the photo comes from backwards towards the front.
  * In the first paragraph the 'Menu', linked to the menu page has the background-color and the text-color inverted when we hover over so will make aware the user that is a clickable link.
  * The same style applies to the email in contact details so we keep the same structure and style over the page. 

## Tests ##

 * I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and function on all standard screen sizes using the Chrome Developer Tool.
 * I confirmed that all the navigation links are working.
 * I confirmed that all text is readable and easy to understand.
