            Welcome to <span id="dname">Drury Buildings</span>, a unique venue right in the city center of Dublin, with a superb colour vibrancy
            from our street art wallpaper. Before it became the building with the beautiful mural it was a sewing factory and we are very
            proud to say that the building itself was earmarked for demolition when we took it on. However we had a different vision because 
            sustainability is very important to us. Captured carbon in our built environment has to stay captured if we want to have 
            sustainable cities.
            During our journey, first started in 2013, we developed a place with a perfect athmosphere where you and your friends can 
            <em>Eat, Drink and Enjoy!</em> from a wide range of unique choices. Our dedicated team is working endless to combine
            multiple concepts to create the perfect <a href="menu.html" id="link-menu">Menu.</a>
